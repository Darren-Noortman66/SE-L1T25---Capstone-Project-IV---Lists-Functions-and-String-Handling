# SE-L1T25---Capstone-Project-IV---Lists-Functions-and-String-Handling
My final Capstone Project in the first level of my course with Hyperion Development.

## This project is used to run a task management system that stores data into text files. This is an upgraded version of previous Capstone Project. This project has added functionality compared to the previous one.


* **What is this repo or project?**

    This project is used to run a task management system that stores data into text files. This is an upgraded version of previous Capstone Project. This project has added functionality compared to the previous one.
* **How does it work?**

    This project works with python only and is executed using the 'task_manager.py' file. The other files are text files created by the program. Simply follow the instructions/ options presented to work with the program.
* **Who will use this repo or project?**

    This project has not really been made for anyone except for my mentors at Hyperion-Development. (Hyperion-Dev Project)
* **What is the goal of this project?**
    
    This project is meant to store login-information for users authorised to use it. It then allows authorised users to run a task-management-system program that will read and write to text files containing task and user information.


## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.

Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .py, such as PyCharm. (If you don't have one installed.)
Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'task_manager.py' file. This is the execution file for the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you will have options/ instructions printed on the screen for you. Choose amongst these options to work with the program as you wish. You will be required to insert a username and password that is valid. Once you have, then you will be able to work with tasks.

To test your input/ code, you can look at the output written to the text-files to see if the information presented is correct.


## How you can help

No help is needed right now, as these are currently being marked to Hyperion-Development's standards. However, if you do see improvements that can be made, then please feel free to point them out :D
